				Thanks for checking out my website! My name is Christian Dinh and I'm a software engineer
				living in NYC. Most of my experience is in front end web dev, but I probably wouldn't
				mind the opportunity to branch out a bit. If you're interested in a more detailed description
				of my experience take a look at <AppLink app={Resume}>my resume</AppLink>, and if you're
				interested in examples of my work take a look at <AppLink app={Projects}>my projects</AppLink> :D

				Outside of programming, I {'<3'} music! I play a few instruments (bass is my fav),
				compose chiptune music on my gameboy, and go to a lot of live shows (when I'm not living
				through a pandemic). Some of <AppLink app={MediaPlayer}>my music</AppLink> is hosted on
				this website. Some other things I think are dope: movies, Magic: The Gathering (mostly EDH and
				proxy vintage), video games, snowboarding, cooking, cocktails, and long walks on the beach.
